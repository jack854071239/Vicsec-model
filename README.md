# Vicsek-model

# Vicsek model is a particle movement simulation. The purpose of this simulating is to mimic particles in bio-environment movement and interaction among each other. 

# Giving a defined area, however this area is borderless, which means whenever the particle passing through the board the particle will appear on another side of the boarder. There are several parameters that need to be defined, the number of particles(N), times of simulation(tmax), velocity of particle(v), size of the area(L), and the noise of particle(noise).  The total number of particles defined how many particles in this area, and the size of the area is a rectangular area who has length of L. This simulation is performed by calculating particle movements in each second, and tmax represents the total time of simulating in order to find the desire result. Noise in this simulation will represent how much each particle deviate from each other in the direction of movement, the larger the noise the more random it moves. From a macro perspective, each particle is assigned with a random initial position in the area. Vary particle has a constant speed of moving in the same direction when noise is zero. When noise is not zero, the particle will travel at random direction according to parameter of noise, the higher the noise the larger angle it might travel from other particles.
